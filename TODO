[x] creating a working script that connects to arduino using cutecom
[ ] sampling one channel
    [x] understanding hot to connect cables
    [ ] understanding how to analogread from avr
    [ ] ADC is the bunch of registers which are involved in analog digital convertertion
    [ ] understanding how to adc from all channels
    [ ] once convertion is completed I have to enable an ISR which send data through serial (VIA INTERRUPT!)
    [ ] once data arrived I need to plot them!
    [ ] I need to figure out how to plot one channel
[ ] avoid using cutecom
